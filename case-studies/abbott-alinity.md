# Case Study: ML Pipeline Cloud Migration

> **Industry**: Healthcare/Medical Devices  
> **Duration**: 15 months  
> **Role**: Senior ScrumMaster / Tech Program Lead

## Context

A global medical device company needed to migrate their ML pipeline for diagnostic devices from on-premises infrastructure to a hybrid cloud architecture while maintaining FDA compliance.

## Problem

- Legacy on-premises ML pipeline handling 27,000+ devices
- 6-month model deployment cycles
- Upcoming FDA audit requiring documented compliance
- Growing data volumes exceeding capacity

## Approach

1. **Assessment**: Mapped existing pipeline, identified compliance requirements
2. **Architecture**: Designed hybrid Azure/AWS solution with HIPAA compliance
3. **Migration**: Phased migration with zero-downtime cutover
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing for FDA audit readiness

## Outcomes

- **Zero audit findings** during FDA inspection
- Model deployment time: **6 months → 3 weeks**
- Achieved **HIPAA-compliant** data plane
- Supported **45+ data scientists** on new platform

## What I Would Productize

- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance patterns for ML pipelines
- Hybrid cloud migration playbook
- Model validation and audit trail templates
